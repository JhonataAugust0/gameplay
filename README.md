## :bookmark: Resume
<br />

Have you ever wanted to play together with your friends for fun, but were never able to schedule a fixed time?

GamePlay was created precisely to solve this problem! GamePlay schedules games with your friends and with its API integration.
Discord, which makes this process even easier.

Hope you like the project, the project was built by Rocketseat at NLW-Together (an event consisting of a week of lots of code
and challenges for us devs to get to the next level) and developed by me, hope you like the project!
